The entire project has been rewritten in typescript for a more robust typescript
experience. New issue and pull request templates have been added along
with a [contributing](/docs/about/contributing) guide for anyone who would like 
to contribute to the project. Lastly this documentation site has been created 
to serve as a knowledge base for all things related to the IdleTimer project.
If you have any ideas for sections, demos or tutorials to add feel free to start a 
[discussion](https://github.com/supremetechnopriest/react-idle-timer/discussions) 
or open an [issue](https://github.com/supremetechnopriest/react-idle-timer/issues/new/choose).

If you are upgrading from v4 there are a few breaking changes that you should
take into account. The rest of the API has not changed. Only new features
and improvements to existing ones.

## Breaking Changes

#### Removal of `<IdleTimer />` Component

The major change in v5 is the removal of the `IdleTimer` component. It has been
replaced with the [withIdleTimer](/docs/api/withIdleTimer) higher order component.
You can use the higher order component to create the `IdleTimer` component if you
wish and it would be a drop in replacement for the v4 component. A guide on how
to do that can be found [here](/docs/api/with-idle-timer#idletimer-component).

#### Simplified Cross Tab API

The Cross Tab feature has been rewritten from the ground up. It is now much smaller
and more specialized for this particular use case. All the edge cases have been
solved and the API surface has been reduced to the essentials. 

In v4, the `crossTab` prop used to take a `boolean` or an `object` of configuration
options. Now in v5, the `crossTab` prop only takes a `boolean`. This is how you
enable or disable the Cross Tab Reconciliation feature. It is disabled by default.

All of the rest of the options from v4 have been set to sane defaults. 
This results in a more simple API surface and less type ambiguity.
Events are emitted on all tabs by default and leader election has been reduced
down to the `leaderElection` prop and the `isLeader` method. See more about leader
election in the [next section](/docs/getting-started/new#leader-election).

A new property has been added called `syncTimers`. It takes a `number` that
represents the throttle value in milliseconds for the sync function. Every user
action that is defined in the `events` array will be replicated to all tabs, thus
keeping the timeouts across tabs roughly in sync. By default this property has
a value of 0 which is equivalent to disabled. Set it to the maximum amount of
drift between timeouts that is tolerable for you project. Setting it too low will
cause a lot of messaging between tabs. A good place to start is around `200`. 

In v4 the following code...
```jsx
// Hook
const idleTimer = useIdleTimer({
  crossTab: {
    type: undefined,
    channelName: 'idle-timer',
    fallbackInterval: 2000,
    responseTime: 100,
    removeTimeout: 1000 * 60,
    emitOnAllTabs: true
  }
})

// Component
<IdleTimer crossTab={{
  type: undefined,
  channelName: 'idle-timer',
  fallbackInterval: 2000,
  responseTime: 100,
  removeTimeout: 1000 * 60,
  emitOnAllTabs: false
}} />
```

Becomes this in v5...

```jsx
// Hook
const idleTimer = useIdleTimer({
  crossTab: true
})

// Higher Order Component Wrapped 
<IdleTimer crossTab />
```

With the new `syncTimers` feature:

```jsx
// Hook
const idleTimer = useIdleTimer({
  crossTab: true,
  syncTimers: 200
})

// Higher Order Component Wrapped 
<IdleTimer crossTab syncTimers={200} />
```

If you are using multiple IdleTimer instances on the same page, you can use the
`name` prop to isolate crossTab events to their respective instances.

```jsx
// Hook
const logoutTimer = useIdleTimer({
  timeout: 1000 * 60 * 30,
  crossTab: true,
  syncTimers: 200,
  name: 'logout-timer'
})

const activityTimer = useIdleTimer({
  timeout: 1000 * 60 * 5,
  crossTab: true,
  syncTimers: 200,
  name: 'activity-timer'
})

// Higher Order Component Wrapped 
<IdleTimer crossTab timeout={1000 * 60 * 30} syncTimers={200} name='logout-timer' />
<IdleTimer crossTab timeout={1000 * 60 * 5} syncTimers={200} name='activity-timer' />
```

There is also a new method [getTabId()](/docs/api/methods#gettabid) that will 
return the current tabs id that is used internally by IdleTimer's `crossTab` feature.

#### Leader Election
In v4 Leader Election was enabled by default and would automatically emit events
on only the leader tab. In v5, leader election has to be enabled manually by
setting the [leaderElection](/docs/api/props#leaderelection) property. In order
to emit events only on the leader, you can use the [isLeader](/docs/api/methods#isleader)
method inside your event handlers.

```js
import { useIdleTimer } from 'react-idle-timer'

const App = () => {
  const { isLeader } = useIdleTimer({
    crossTab: true,
    leaderElection: true,
    onIdle: () => {
      if (isLeader()) {
        // I am the leader, perform remote action
      } else {
        // I am not the leader, perform local action
      }
    }
  })

  return <></>
}
```

#### Last Active and Idle Times
The `getLastActiveTime()` and `getLastIdleTime()` methods now return 
[Date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) 
objects instead of a timestamp. This will eliminate the need to cast to a Date 
before formatting. If you want to get the old timestamp you can just call 
`getLastActiveTime().getTime()` and `getLastIdleTime().getTime()`.

## Non Breaking Changes

#### Removal of `passive` and `capture` Props

The `passive` and `capture` props have been removed and are automatically set to
true. There is no good reason a user would want to set either of them to `false`
and as such, they have been removed to reduce complexity and API surface. If you 
were to leave these props set in your `useIdleTimer` hook or `withIdleTimer` 
higher order component, they wouldn't do anything. This is not necessarily a 
breaking change but something that is good to be aware of while migrating.

## New Features

### Web Worker Timers

When a window is backgrounded, the browser will throttle timers in an attempt to 
save on CPU cycles. This can cause IdleTimer to produce delayed and inaccurate 
results. To combat this, the timers interface has been exposed as a property and
an implementation of WebWorker thread timers are exposed in order to keep them 
alive when a window is throttled by the browser. The worker is provided via a 
blob URL and this can cause strict CSP rules to be violated. It is strongly 
suggested that you update your rule to allow the worker to run so the timers are 
accurate. If this is not an option, you can omit the `timers` property and use
the default main thread timers. Main thread timers are the default in order to 
allow projects that wish to omit worker thread timers to tree shake out the
worker code. If you decide to enable worker timers, take a look at 
[Testing Considerations](/docs/getting-started/testing) for information on how 
to mock these timers for your test suites.

```js
import { useIdleTimer, workerTimers } from 'react-idle-timer'

export const App = () => {
  const idleTimer = useIdleTimer({ timers: workerTimers })

  return (
    <h1>Using web worker timers!</h1>
  )
}
```

### Integrated Prompting

A common use case for IdleTimer is to detect when your user is idle and then 
open a modal to ask the user if they are still there. There have been a lot of 
questions about how to do this, so in v5, the IdleTimer will handle it for you.

The new `promptTimeout` configuration option along with the `onPrompt` callback
and `isPrompted()` state getter is all you need to prompt your user before going 
idle. 

Here is a minimal example. More complete examples can be found in the 
[features](/docs/features/confirm-prompt) section.

```jsx
export function App () {
  // Set timeout values
  const timeout = 1000 * 60 * 30
  const promptTimeout = 1000 * 30

  // Modal open state
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false)

  // Time before idle
  const [remaining, setRemaining] = useState(0)

  const onPrompt = () => {
    // onPrompt will be called after the timeout value is reached
    // In this case 30 minutes. Here you can open your prompt. 
    // All events are disabled while the prompt is active. 
    // If the user wishes to stay active, call the `reset()` method.
    // You can get the remaining prompt time with the `getRemainingTime()` method,
    setOpen(true)
    setRemaining(promptTimeout)
  }
  
  const onIdle = () => {
    // onIdle will be called after the promptTimeout is reached.
    // In this case 30 seconds. Here you can close your prompt and 
    // perform what ever idle action you want such as log out your user.
    // Events will be rebound as long as `stopOnMount` is not set.
    setOpen(false)
    setRemaining(0)
  }
  
  const onActive = () => {
    // onActive will only be called if `reset()` is called while `isPrompted()` 
    // is true. Here you will also want to close your modal and perform
    // any active actions. 
    setOpen(false)
    setRemaining(0)
  }

  const { getRemainingTime, isPrompted, reset } = useIdleTimer({
    timeout,
    promptTimeout,
    onPrompt,
    onIdle,
    onActive
  })

  const handleStillHere = () => {
    setOpen(false)
    reset()
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      if (isPrompted()) {
        setRemaining(Math.ceil(getRemainingTime() / 1000))
      }
    }, 1000)
    return () => {
      clearInterval(interval)
    }
  }, [getRemainingTime, isPrompted])

  return (
    <div className='modal' style={{ display: open ? 'block' : 'none' }}>
      <p>Logging you out in {remaining} seconds</p>
      <button onClick={handleStillHere}>Im Still Here</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Cross Tab Messaging

IdleTimer now exposes its cross tab messaging layer so you can easily broadcast
arbitrary messages to all instances of your page running in all tabs. This is 
exposed by two new APIs...

a message callback:
```ts
onMessage?: (data: string | number | object) => void
```

and a message emitter:
```ts
message (data: string | number | object, emitOnSelf?: boolean): void
```

Using these mechanisms, you can use IdleTimer to send messages to all instances
of your application. Here is a basic example with redux.

```jsx
import { useIdleTimer } from 'react-idle-timer'
import { useDispatch } from 'react-redux'
import { logAction } from './Actions'

export function App () {
  // Action dispatcher (redux)
  const dispatch = useDispatch()

  // Message handler 
  const onMessage = data => {
    switch (data.action) {
      case 'LOGOUT_USER':
        dispatch(logoutAction())
        break
      // More actions
      default:
        // no op
    }
  }

  // IdleTimer instance
  const { message } = useIdleTimer({ onMessage })

  // Logout button click
  const onLogoutClick = () => {
    // Tell all tabs to log the user out. 
    // Passing true as a second parameter will
    // also emit the event in this tab.
    message({ action: 'LOGOUT_USER' }, true)
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={onLogoutClick}>Logout</button>
  )
}
```

More complete examples can be found in the [features](/docs/features/cross-tab)
section.

### Immediate Events

A new configuration option called `immediateEvents` has been added. 

```ts
immediateEvents?: IEventsType[]
```

Any events added to `immediateEvents` will immediately switch the user into an 
idle or prompted state, calling `onIdle` or `onPrompt` respectively. This is
useful for events such as `pagehide`, where you want to bypass the timeout and
go directly to an idle state. 

If an event is set in both `events` and `immediateEvents`, the immediate event
will take precedence allowing you to override the default events if you like.

### Higher Order Component

With the removal of the `IdleTimer` component, the `withIdleTimer` higher order 
component is now the default way to add IdleTimer to class components. More about
the higher order component [here](/docs/api/with-idle-timer).

### Provider

If you need to access the IdleTimer API in nested children, you can opt to use 
the `IdleTimerProvider` rather than drilling props through your App's hierarchy.
More about the Provider and related exports [here](/docs/api/idle-timer-provider).

### Activate Method
The `reset` method will now reset IdleTimer to it's initial state only. It will no
longer call `onActive` if the user was idle. This functionality has been replaced
by the [activate()](/docs/api/methods#active) method. You can call `activate()` to
manually activate a user, resetting the timer and calling `onActive` if the user
was idle.
