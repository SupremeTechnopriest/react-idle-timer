### 5.3.0
<Divider />

#### ✨ Enhancements
- The `reset` method now respects `startManually` property. It will no longer automatically call `onActive`.
- Export `DEFAULT_EVENTS` for easy extension of events.

#### 🐞 Bug Fixes
- The `getRemainingTime` method now always returns the time to idle instead of time to prompt and then time to idle.
- Debounced `onAction` callbacks will automatically be cancelled on idle.

### 5.2.0
<Divider />

#### ✨ Enhancements
- Add `name` property to support multiple instances when `crossTab` is enabled.

### 5.1.3
<Divider />

#### 🐞 Bug Fixes
- Use builtin `Omit` over utility-types `Subtract`. Fixes missing dependency error.

### 5.1.2
<Divider />

#### ✨ Enhancements
- Forward ref on `withIdleTimer`.

### 5.1.1
<Divider />

#### 🐞 Bug Fixes
- Add missing React import in `withIdleTimer`.

### 5.1.0
<Divider />

#### ⚡️ Features
- Add new implementation of Leader Election.

> Due to popular request, Leader Election has returned in version 5.1.0. 
> While the old implementation was incompatible with v5, this new implementation 
> is compatible. A new property `leaderElection` is exposed to enable the feature. 
> The major difference between the v4 and v5 implementation is that in v5 events 
> are not isolated to your leader tab automatically. You will need to call the 
> `isLeader` method inside your event handlers. See the 
> [docs](https://idletimer.dev/docs/getting-started/new#leader-election) 
> for more information.

## 5.0.0
<Divider />

> Version 5 is a complete, from scratch, typescript rewrite. A lot of effort went
> into this release. If you find this package useful and have the means, please
> consider a small [donation](https://github.com/sponsors/supremetechnopriest)!

### 4.6.4
<Divider />

#### 🐞 Bug Fixes
- Make `ref` optional in typedef.

### 4.6.3
<Divider />

#### ✨ Enhancements
- Export a bundle for modern browsers.

#### 🐞 Bug Fixes
- Add missing `ref` to TypeScript definitions.
- Fix a bug where reset would not propagate cross tab.

### 4.6.2
<Divider />

#### ✨ Enhancements
- Allow for dynamically setting `onActive` and `onIdle` event handlers in conjunction with cross tab event reconciliation.

### 4.6.1
<Divider />

#### ✨ Enhancements
- When `emitOnAllTabs` is set to `true`, `start`, `reset`, `pause` and `resume` will be called on all tabs.
- Calling `reset` will now automatically fire `onActive` while calling `start` will not. Otherwise these two methods are functionally equivalent.

#### 🐞 Bug Fixes
- Fix an issue where the `localStorage` method would not call `idle` if there wasn't any user activity on the page.
- Fix an issue where the `TabManager` would not deregister itself when the tab was closed if it was not the leader tab.

#### 🚿 Clean up
- Fix a type-o in propTypes, typescript definitions and docs.

## 4.6.0
<Divider />

#### ⚡️ Features
- Add cross tab support. See examples and README for usage and documentation.
- Add an `isLeader()` method that returns a boolean indicating whether or not the current tab is the lead orchestrator for cross tab reconciliation.
- Add a `startManually` configuration option to enable starting of the timer and activity detection manually. An alias to `reset()` called `start()` is also exposed to keep the code more semantic. If `startManually` is set to `true`, the `IdleTimer` component and `useIdleTimer` hook wont start until `reset()` or `start()` are called.

#### 🐞 Bug Fixes
- Fix a bug where throttle and debounce wouldn't work at higher values in useIdleTimer.

## 4.2.0
<Divider />

#### ⚡️ Features
- Dynamically bind and unbind events.

Events are unbound when:
- `stopOnIdle` is set to `true` and the user goes idle
- `pause()` is called

Events are bound when:
- component is mounted
- `reset()` is called
- `resume()` is called

### 4.1.3
<Divider />

#### 🐞 Bug Fixes
- `stopOnIdle` will now keep `IdleTimer` in idle state until `reset()` is called.

### 4.1.2
<Divider />

#### 🐞 Bug Fixes
- Fix a bug where `stopOnIdle` logic was being applied to active state.

### 4.1.1
<Divider />

#### 🐞 Bug Fixes
- Fix a bug where initial `onIdle` event was not firing when `stopOnIdle` is set

## 4.1.0
<Divider />

#### ⚡️ Features
- Add property `stopOnIdle` defaults to `false`. Setting to `true` will prevent user activity from restarting the `IdleTimer` once it has gone idle. This useful if you want to do some custom async stuff before the `IdleTimer` gets restarted. In order to restart the `IdleTimer` call `reset()` on your ref.
- Add event handler `onActive` which enables reporting of all user activity from `IdleTimer`. The built in `debounce` or `throttle` properties will help increase performance if you are using the `onActive` event. By default `debounce` and `throttle` are off. Only one can be enabled at a time.
- Add property `debounce` defaults to 0. Set the `onActive` debounce delay in milliseconds. The `throttle` property cannot be set if this property is set.
- Add property `throttle` defaults to 0. Set the `onActive` throttle delay in milliseconds. The `debounce` property cannot be set if this property is set.

## 4.0.0
<Divider />

Version 4.0 contains a rewrite of the build system and a refactor of the source
code for IdleTimer. After accepting many pull requests, the projects code style
was destroyed, so some forced styling was added and PRs that don't respect this
style will not be accepted. Contribution guide now on the README.

#### 🔥 Code Removal
- The property `startOnLoad` has been renamed to `startOnMount` to make more sense in a react context.
- The property `activeAction` has been renamed to `onActive`.
- The property `idleAction` has been renamed to `onIdle`.

#### ✨ Enhancements
- Add [passive](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener) property. Defaults to `true`, bind events with passive mode enabled.
- Add [capture](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener) property. Defaults to `true`, bind events with capture mode enabled.
- Pass event through to `onActive` callback functions.

#### 🐞 Bug Fixes
- Fixed installation bug on windows machines. This was due to the use of environment variables in the build scripts. The new build system does not rely on environment variables defined at the cli level

## 3.0.0
<Divider />

Dropped support for date formatting in version 3. IdleTimer returns raw
date objects and you can use which ever library you like to format it. If you
would like to continue using the built in formatter, stick with version 2.

#### 🔥 Breaking Changes
- Removed built in date formatter.

## 2.0.0
<Divider />

#### ⚡️ Features
- Add support for server side rendering.

## 1.0.0
<Divider />
